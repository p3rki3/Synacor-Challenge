#This file is a list of instructions to the VM once it starts asking for input characters
#The instructions in this file will be used until they run out, when the user can type the next instructions if required
#The codes are also recorded here
#First code is in the architectural specification    -    WAVnxqIyblPQ
#Second code is displayed when the VM is able to run using a minimal instruction set    -   DZzsWkpjlyIq
#and the third code is printed above when the self test is completed and the VM is fully operational (we hope)   -   NXAmQBTRWUez
#Some special characters in this file including this one (@) that causes a pause of 60 seconds
#The ~ character causes the VM to return to user input and ignore any following instructions (useful for debugging this script)
#The $ character instructs the VM to stop as we have finished the challenge
#The @ character will cause the VM to pause for 15 seconds
#The < character will cause the VM to slow down printing of output (you can also set this in the call to the class constructor)
#And a > character will speed it up again
#The ^ character will cause a dump of the current program code
#And the { and } characters will start and stop an ip trace which will saved at the end of the program when you send a $ instruction
#Finally, the [ and ] characters will start and stop a FULL trace of a section on code in the VM - be warned, lots of outout to console!

#You are in a grid that looks like this and you need to find a sum moving from bottom left and ending top right that takes you from 22 to 30
#|-----|-----|-----|-----|
#|  *  |  8  |  -  |  1  |
#|-----|-----|-----|-----|
#|  4  |  *  | 11  |  *  |
#|-----|-----|-----|-----|
#|  +  |  4  |  -  | 18  |
#|-----|-----|-----|-----|
#| 22  |  -  |  9  |  *  |

#So my solution is 22+4-11*4-18-11-1 = 30  (running total is calculated after each operation; no order of precedence)
